## Borderlands 3 Save Editor

A desktop based save _and_ profile editor for [Borderlands 3](borderlands.com/).

### Installation / Usage

1. Download the exe/zip for your respective OS/setup available on the [Releases](https://github.com/FromDarkHell/BL3SaveEditor/releases) tab.
   - _Which one do I download?_ If you don't know which one to download, you probably will want to download `BL3SaveEditor-Portable.zip`<sup>[here](https://github.com/FromDarkHell/BL3SaveEditor/releases/latest/download/BL3SaveEditor-Portable.zip)</sup>. This is a self-contained windows binary. If that one doesn't launch for you, try downloading `BL3SaveEditor.zip`<sup>[here](https://github.com/FromDarkHell/BL3SaveEditor/releases/latest/download/BL3SaveEditor.zip)</sup>.
2. Then you download / run the exe
3. Click `Open`, then you can select either a profile (`profile.sav`) or a game save (`[NUMBERS].sav`).
4. You can now edit your profile or game save to your hearts content!
5. Once you think you're done editing your saves, you can save your file with either the `Save` button (which will overwrite your loaded file), or use the `Save As` button, allowing you to save to a new file. In either case, it will make backups to help keep your saves protected!

- [gibbed](https://github.com/Gibbed) for their [Inventory Serial Number Database](https://github.com/gibbed/Borderlands3Dumps). It's what allows me to know what weapons you've got in your backpack! I also use their [Borderlands3Protos](https://github.com/gibbed/Borderlands3Protos) repository
- [apocalyptech](https://github.com/apocalyptech/) for writing the incredibly helpful [guide](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/wiki/Understanding-BL3-Item-Serial-Numbers) on parsing weapon serials.
- [Benjamin Ruhl](https://github.com/benruehl) for creating [AdonisUI](https://github.com/benruehl/adonis-ui), the WPF toolkit I used for most of my UI development/theming.
- [xceed software](https://github.com/xceedsoftware) for creating the [Extended WPF Toolkit](https://github.com/xceedsoftware/wpftoolkit), allowing me to have a `Raw` tab and number up/downs.
- [Gearbox Software](https://www.gearboxsoftware.com/) of course for creating Borderlands 3.
- Many others who helped test the editor as well as help me get my mind around some of the concepts.
